NAME
    PlugAuth::Plugin::Finger - Add a finger protocol interface to your
    PlugAuth server

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
    In your PlugAuth.conf:

     plugins:
       - PlugAuth::Plugin::Finger: {}

    Then from the command line, to list all users/groups:

     % finger @localhost

    and from the command line, to query a user or group:

     % finger foo@localhost

    and to see the granted permissions:

     % finger -l foo@localhost

DESCRIPTION
    This plugin provides a finger protocol interface to PlugAuth. Through it
    you can see the users, groups and their permissions through the finger
    interface.

    By default this plugin will listen to port 79 on Windows, or when the
    user is privileged under Unix. Otherwise it will listen to port 8079.
    Many finger clients cannot be configured to connect to a different port,
    but you can use "iptables" on Linux, or use an equivalent tool on other
    operating systems to forward port 79 to port 8079.

CAVEATS
    This plugin won't work as currently implemented if you are using a
    start_mode which forks, such as hypnotoad. Until that is solved this
    plugin will probably prevent you from scaling your PlugAuth deployment.
